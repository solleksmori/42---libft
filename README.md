# <center>Libft</center>

The libft project is part of the 42 School core curriculum. It aims to create a library of essential C functions that the student can then use throughout the rest of the studies. The library consists of both recreations of existing C library functions as well as various other useful functions. 

Libft is the first project I completed in my studies. It helped me develop my programming skils on a fundamental level as well as provided me with an understanding of how these functions work on a deeper level. 

## Description

The libft library contains a portable collection of utility functions that can be used in different projects.
